# CPSC 222 Final Project - Credit Card Transaction History

## Organization
This project is organized into one main jupyter notebook file, a utility file and multiple .csv files.
* The jupyter notebook contains the entirety of the technical report and a majority of the source code.
* The utility file (utils.py) contains the rest of the source code that is not in the notebook.
* The .csv files contain data that is referenced and worked with in the jupyter notebook.

## How To Run
In order to run this project correctly all files in the repository need to be present in the same folder the jupyter notebook is being run from. As long as the notebook is being run from a file also containing the utils.py file and .csv files it will run as intended.
